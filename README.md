# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis

## Project Overview
Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-share program with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations, aims to maximize annual memberships. Annual memberships generate more revenue compared to casual riders. This project analyzes historical bike trip data to understand user behavior and design marketing strategies that encourage casual riders to become annual members.

## Key Objectives
1. Understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.
2. Explore reasons casual riders might purchase annual memberships.
3. Develop strategies using digital media to convert casual riders into annual members.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains trip information and user details:

- **Trip Information:**
  - `ride_id`: Unique identifier for each trip.
  - `start_station_name`, `end_station_name`: Starting and ending stations.
  - `started_at`, `ended_at`: Date and time of trip start and end.
  - `start_lat`, `start_lng`, `end_lat`, `end_lng`: Coordinates for trip locations.

- **User Information:**
  - `member_casual`: Categorizes users as "member" (annual subscribers) or "casual" (short-term or occasional users).

### Data Preprocessing
1. **Handling Null Values:** Cleaned missing or incomplete data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new features such as ride duration and distance.
3. **Data Type Corrections:** Ensured proper formatting of dates and numeric fields.

## Analysis Process
1. **Usage Patterns:**
   - Analyzed ride duration, frequency, and time of day usage.
   - Examined differences in peak hours for casual riders and annual members.
2. **Membership Benefits:**
   - Highlighted cost savings, convenience, and additional perks for members.
3. **Digital Media Strategies:**
   - Proposed targeted advertising, content marketing, and social media campaigns.

## Findings and Insights
- **Ride Duration and Distance:** Casual riders tend to take longer trips compared to members.
- **Usage Frequency:** Members use bikes more consistently, especially during weekdays.
- **Time of Day Patterns:** Casual riders prefer weekend rides, while members use bikes for daily commutes.
- **Membership Value:** Annual memberships offer significant cost savings and convenience, especially for frequent users.

## Recommendations
To encourage casual riders to become annual members, Cyclistic should:

1. **Implement Targeted Marketing Campaigns:**
   - Focus on cost-saving benefits and convenience.
   - Highlight testimonials and success stories of current members.

2. **Leverage Digital Media:**
   - Utilize social media platforms and email marketing to reach casual riders.
   - Partner with influencers to promote the annual membership benefits.

3. **Offer Incentives:**
   - Provide discounts or referral bonuses for new memberships.
   - Introduce trial memberships to showcase benefits.
